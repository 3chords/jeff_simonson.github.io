    <h3>Findings...</h3>
    <p> Cloudiness has a high incidence of clear days but it also reveals possible 
      clusters at 0%, 20%, 40%, 75-80% and 100%. However, this might be more a way 
      of how cloudiness is measured. In the northern hemisphere between 20 & 40 degrees 
      there is a high incidence of 0% cloudiness which makes me think there might be a 
      heat wave in those cities.</p>
